# WEEK 3 SKO

In week 3 class, I have a further understanding of drawing machines (a machine who does not need code, just a touch of nature). From 1922 we had the first reading machine till today, so many exciting work have been done. It is excellent to look at these art throughs, especially mosquito-translator. I was attracted by the appearance of this installation, curious about how it works. And after reading through the meaning behind it, I was shocked by what it is representing. For the Anthropocentrism, I would only think about it when there is a conflict of human are slaving robots (like senses in Blade Runner), but it could also about all the non-human creatures like mosquitos. How human going to feel what they feel.

I saw the possibility of drawing machines; a pen/pint could be motivated by anything, like wind, birds, a bubble with charcoal pencil.

In the afternoon class, we fill up 80 inputs and outputs with HOW, where some interesting ideas came.

Andy talks about the experience of  their working process of at starting point for a project. A notable advice is list the possible ideas just like what we did for the input and output. With some comparison, researches and  experiments, then decide which one could go further. The key from my end is keep working, trying and taking mistakes.


## Ideas for ASS 2
This is the chart that I did for ASS 2

It seems like I got a strong preference at a very early stage. I think for my project, I would go with the idea of helping people from a suicide bridge. 

The concept comes from recent news claiming that the suicide rate is predicted to increase (25 per cent more suicide deaths annually) because of COV 19. And I believe art can help, from the practice field there is art therapy for depressions. I found there is a Chinese artist/academic had similar research in 2008. His approach is writing down the “where is the capital city of Madagascar” on the famous suicide bridge in Nanjing. The fact is it does help; there are many lives that he saved, sending him a letter of thank. http://www.zgnfys.com/a/nfms-16154.shtml 

So what I am trying to do is an interactive installation which can draw people’s attention and bring them back from the dead-end from their perspective. 

Inspired by this sketch, I could create an algorithm that could let people and the background come together little by little (by pixel).

## In-Class activity

I have a chance to make my drawing machine.
I did three trials.
This first one I paint with the wheels of my office chair. And the paints are soft pastels. The wheel track blends these two colours.

I made an iron wireframe for the second and third ones. Considering the high the frame is the minor the pen should move, which means easy to operate. I put two acrylic paint on the square and hang a light plastic folk on top. The force comes from my hair dyer and healer. As time passes, the colours start to dry, until the fork can not move it, the painting was born.

The last trial I change the folk into a pen, so the drawing can keep going as long as the hairdryer is open.
