# Week 5

## Note from PPP
It is a pleasure to go through other people’s projects. Everyone’s idea hit my mind!! Some of them raised my interest, like memory machine and the idea of reading without reading, and wondering how they will make them happen, feeling excited only about my outcome and others. Sadly, we only got 5 mins for each person and can not write down everything.

Luckily, I can comment on two student’s work and spend time viewing their ppt carefully.

There is some research from peer's ppt that raised my interest. 

Refik Anadol’s work Melting Memories 
http://refikanadol.com/works/melting-memories/
Anadol gathers data on the neural mechanisms of cognitive control from an EEG (electroencephalogram) that measures changes in brain wave activity and provides evidence of how the brain functions over time. These data sets constitute the building blocks for the unique algorithms that the artist needs for the multi-dimensional visual structures on display.

Rotterdam-based architect cosimo scotucci has envisioned a dynamic installation to ensure social distancing measures are adhered to. to be placed in front of rotterdam central station, ‘physx’ goes one step further than the static solutions we have already seen, such as circles marked on the grass in parks, or tape on supermarket floors so you know how much distance to keep. this proposal instead uses colored fibers that move as you do, all the while defining a safe zone of 1.5 meters.
