# Week 1 


My level of practice. I do not know HTML, CSS but a bit of understanding of JavaScript. And a fundamental level of Arduino.
Here is a code that I made during this holiday. https://editor.p5js.org/Athena/sketches/aUL__Z7Fc
I am at a very beginning level and willing to learn more. 

<h1>Note from pre-reading</h1>
Which gives me a bit of understanding of what generative art is.

“Why Love Generative Art?”
shows images of kinds of generative art. It gives me some knowledge of what generative art can be/ can do in today’s practice.


“GENERATIVE PRACTICE. THE STATE OF THE ART”
-Generative Art is about the various possible forms of creative collaboration between a human and a non-human.

-Generative art expresses the dynamic creativity we associate with selfcausing agents. 

-Can generative practice provide a critical perspective on the growing autonomy of non-human systems?


-I imagine it would be interesting to plan it, not in terms of artists or artworks, but in terms of the autonomous systems involved. I would try to get together a wide variety of species and personalities, from the mechanical to the digital, and from the abstract to the physical  a veritable assembly of automata that would open a space for the richest possible dialogue and contrast among them. 






# Takeaway from class

<body>In today’s class, Karen talks about what is generative art and introduces a list of artist are their works.


I looked up some base on my interest

This one really shocks me of how real these people look.

This one impressed me the most. When I was clicking it what came to my mind is that it looks like a prototype of people’s footprint on the internet work in nowadays. Every step is quite random but with thousands of connections.

And this one, I really like the idea of words changed after time and if people who can not read it within a period that they set them this letter would be unreadable.

Some works/technique I like apart form the list

# Activity
We made a painting system with some essential elements. 
This is the outcome

2.5 fingerprint,3.3 left, 5.5 dodo, 6.4 curly, 2.5 999, 5.4 dragonfly

6.4 curly, 3.4 right, 5.4 dragonfly, 2.6 smooth, 6.2 Zapfino, 5.3 46

Although I and my group number share the same system, there is still a lot of difference in between. This could be an outframe of a coding system.

It sounds like a straightforward activity, but it made me realised how a system was build and how to set rules.

The example that one of my peer talks about the rules of making a breakfast made me understand that anything can be a system and anything can be code. For me, when I was doing the code during the holiday, when I think about the outcome, I would only think of what should I write to make it happen. But now I understand that what I need is a bit of analysing of order, rules and think of it by how.
